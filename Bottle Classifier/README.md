# Bottle Classifier

This code classifies Bottles into water or beverage bottle in a given image.

# Prerequisites

>The code is developed for python 2.7 using a jupyter notebook

>All dependencies are mentioned in Requirements.txt 

# Algorithms

I've used **Convolution Neural Network** for the classification. 

The code reaches a test accuracy **~96%** after 30 epochs.

# Prediction

To run the prediction on a new image just run the following command

```
python evaluate.py --image image_path
```
